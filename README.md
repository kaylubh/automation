### Setup

#### Requirements

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) if not already

1. Create and activate a virtual environment

    `python3 -m venv .venv`

    `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac)

    `source .venv/Scripts/activate` (Windows)

1. Install packages

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Run

***For demonstration purposes the directory path for this implementation is hard-coded to the included directory `user_directory`***

***Mock user directories for `user1` and `user2` are included, any created directories will be added to `user_directory`***

***When specifying a directory path only provide the name of the user directory and not the whole path***

From root of project directory run `python -m directory_manager.manager`.

Currently only menu options 1, 2, 3, and 7 are functional.
